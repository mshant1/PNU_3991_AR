	\begin{block}{Fontana and Frey (1994)}
		``As we treat the other as a human being, we can no longer remain objective, faceless interviewers, but become human beings and must disclose ourselves, learning about ourselves as we try to learn about the other''
	\end{block}
	
	\begin{block}{Weber (1986)}
		``Inviting someone to participate in an interview is extending an invitation to participate in a conversation and build a relationship''
	\end{block}
	
	
	\begin{exampleblock}{Letter of Invitation}
		The e-researcher normally begins the interview process with a letter of invitation.

\frame{\frametitle{Letter of invitation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If the e-researcher does not get a response, the letter should be followed-up with an email message.
		\item Once the prospective participant has agreed to participate, a friendly and somewhat informal message should be sent describing:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The purpose of the study
			\item The process used to maintain confidentiality
			\item How the data will be secured
			\item when and how the results of the study will be disseminated
		\end{itemize}

	\begin{block}{Correspondence should begin the Net-based interviews}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Establish an informal and friendly conversational tone
			\item Appropriate use of humor, self-disclosure, or narrative
			\item Share our own uncertainty and nervousness
			\item Ask relevant questions
		\end{enumerate}
